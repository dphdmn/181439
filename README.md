In this **8-puzzle challenge**, the objective is to optimally solve all 3x3 puzzles starting from scrambled states. 
The optimization is achieved by counting all sub-parts of the solution as solved, meaning that each intermediate state within the sequence of moves also contributes to progress.

## Saving the game:
Use buttons to save/load current progress to file.

### Notes about saving:
*Note 1*: ``Please be aware that upon loading the saved game, the puzzle will already be scrambled to the next random state, and there's no need to press space as it may count as a skip.``

*Note 2*: ``When you save the game, your progress on the current scramble will be lost. Saving in the middle of the solve is not possible due to technical constraints, and it's not recommended anyway.``
